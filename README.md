## Background

The analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) method is a multi-index comprehensive evaluation algorithm. It can be used to calculate the weight of multiple indexes. The intuitionistic Fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process (IFAHP) method introduces interval fuzzies into the AHP method.

The objective problem is follow as:

This code uses the IFAHP method to calculate the weight.
